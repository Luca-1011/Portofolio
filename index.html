    <h2>OUR JOURNEY HAS BEGUN</h2>
    <p>ICT Nature and adventure club went on a climb to Mt. Hakusan on July 16 (Fri). It was a sunny beautiful day with no clouds. We left the Hakusanroku Campus at 5 am and arrived at the starting point (Betto-deai) at 6. Normally it takes 4 hours and 30 minutes to climb Mt Hakusan, which means that it is quite a big mountain.I was very sleey in the car because I woke up at 4:30am in the morning, but when I got to the starting point I was very exciting at the same time. I took 3 bottles of water, ate a sandwich and a calorie mate for breakfast and was ready for the climb. <br> Below, there is a picture of a flower that was blooming in hakusan mountain, and the other picture is us just started climbing and is still very energetic.</p>
