		<h1>MT.HAKUSAN CLIMB </h1>
    <p class="name">N&A club <br>Lucas Kusamoto</p>
    <h2>OUR JOURNEY HAS BEGUN</h2>
    <p>ICT Nature and adventure club went on a climb to Mt. Hakusan on July 16 (Fri). We left the Hakusanroku Campus at 5 am and arrived at the starting point (Betto-deai) at 6. I was very sleepy but also very existing. Normally it takes 4 hours and 30 minutes to climb Mt Hakusan, which means that it is quite a big mountain.</p>
