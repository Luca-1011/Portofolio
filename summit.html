      <h1>SUMMIT!!</h1>
      <p>After 5 hours of walking, 11am we finally made it to the mountain lodge! The view was miraculously beautiful. We ate cup ramen which we brought and ate it all together. Because we were resting for a bit, it was getting a little chilly. After we ate the Ramen we still had to walk around 30 minutes to get to the summit. I couldn't wait to get to the summit so we left the lodge at 11:40 and started walking. Everyone has forgotten how tired they were and started walking real fast. At 12:30 we all made to the summit!! We all took a group photo. I was full with sense of acomplishment. The picture below is the group photo and the picture of the mountain lodge and view.</p>
